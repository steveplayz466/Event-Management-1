                🛠️ 5. Manage Logistics
                Registration: Use an event platform like Eventbrite, Cvent, or Hopin for ticketing and check-ins.
                Tech setup: Ensure A/V, WiFi, and live streaming (if hybrid) work flawlessly.
                Signage and branding: Guide attendees easily with clear signs and branded visuals.
                Food and drink: Plan catering for breaks and meals, considering dietary needs.

                Survey for feedback: Ask what worked and what didn’t for next time.
                Share content: Post key takeaways, photos, or videos on social channels.
                Evaluate success: Compare results to goals — registrations, engagement, revenue, etc.
